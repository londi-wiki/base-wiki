# What is a function?

# Facts

- no side effects allowed
- the output depends on the input
- haskell functions are pure (every specific input results in the same output)

Non function (imperative) applies changes on the memory cells (variables) of the object

Functional programming applies functions to arguments. 
As always, fprog is immutable and the evaluation order isn't relevant.

# Expressions

Expressions can be evaluated step by step by TODO
